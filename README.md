# 📝 Text Generation with Markov Chains  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project implements **Text Generation** using the **Markov Chain model**, a probabilistic approach that predicts the next word in a sequence based on previous words.  
Unlike deep learning-based models, Markov Chains provide a **lightweight and interpretable** method for generating coherent text sequences.  

The model is trained on a text dataset and can produce new sentences that mimic the style, structure, and vocabulary of the training corpus.

## 📂 Dataset Overview  
- **Dataset**: Custom text dataset (uploaded by user)  
- **Content**: Raw text data for training the Markov Chain  
- **Format**: Plain `.txt` file containing sentences or paragraphs  
- **Size**: Varies based on dataset provided  
- **Usage**: The dataset is tokenized into words to build the Markov transition probabilities

## 🎯 Objective  
The main goal of this project is to:  
- Implement a **Markov Chain text generator**.  
- Train the model on a custom text corpus.  
- Generate **syntactically coherent text sequences**.  
- Demonstrate how probabilistic transitions can approximate human-like language generation.

## 🏗️ Models & Algorithms Used  
### 🔹 Markov Chain Model  
- Based on the assumption that **the next state (word) depends only on the current state (previous word)**.  
- Transition matrix built from input corpus.  
- Generates text by sequentially predicting next words using learned probabilities.  

### 🔹 Text Preprocessing  
- Tokenization: Splitting sentences into words.  
- Normalization: Lowercasing, removing special characters.  
- Vocabulary building: Mapping words to states.

## 🔄 Project Workflow  
### ✅ Step 1: Data Loading & Exploration  
- Load custom `.txt` dataset.  
- Inspect corpus for vocabulary size and structure.  

### ✅ Step 2: Preprocessing  
- Clean and tokenize text.  
- Build a **dictionary of word transitions**.  

### ✅ Step 3: Model Construction  
- Build the **Markov Chain transition table**.  
- Store probabilities of next-word occurrences.  

### ✅ Step 4: Text Generation  
- Select a random start word.  
- Iteratively sample next words using transition probabilities.  
- Generate sentences of specified length.  

### ✅ Step 5: Evaluation  
- Assess coherence of generated text.  
- Compare generated samples with training dataset style.

## 📝 Conclusion  
- **Markov Chains** provide a simple yet effective way to generate text.  
- Captures **local word dependencies** but struggles with long-range context.  
- Useful for small-scale projects, educational purposes, and exploring probabilistic language models.  
- Can be extended to **n-gram models** for better context handling.
